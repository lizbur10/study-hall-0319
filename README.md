# JavaScript Functions Practice

## Learning Goals

- Write a function that logs a value
- Write a function that takes in an argument
- Write a function that takes in multiple arguments
- Write a function that uses an optional argument

## Instructions

1. Write a function named `happyHolidays`. This function should not accept any
   arguments and should log the string `"Happy holidays!"`.

2. Write a function named `happyHolidaysTo`. This function should accept one
   argument, the name of the person you want to wish happy holidays to, and
   return the string "Happy holidays, [name]!"

3. Write a function named `happyCustomHolidayTo`. This function should accept
   two arguments: the holiday you want to wish them well for, and the name of
   the person you're wishing well. Order of parameters matters, so make sure to
   first pass in the holiday and then the name. This function should return the
   string "Happy [holiday], [name]!"

4. Write a function named `happyCustomHolidayWithNameOptional`. This function
   should have the same parameters and return value as the previous function,
   but the name should default to 'you'.
